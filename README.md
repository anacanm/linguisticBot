Make sure to first type your twitter api credentials into the config.json file, replacing the "XXXXXXX"s

Run driver.py to connect to the twitter api and generate a table of tweets that have emojis. The default number of tweets to be gathered is 1000. A .csv file will be created in your current directory when the process is done

Accidentally lost or deleted one of your tables? Don't worry! Simply run access.py and type in the name of the table you want (names are printed to the screen to select from), and Bam! a new .csv file will appear for you:)
